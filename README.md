# Welcome to datacraft's polars workshop

In this workshop, we will:

0. Discover what **polars** is and what are its **advantages** (quick presentation)
1. Get familiar with polars through **simple examples** (groupby, aggregations, filtering, renaming, computations..)
2. Work our way through more **advanced features** (window functions, joins, pivoting, melting, selectors..)
3. Compare **execution times** as well as **memory usage** between pandas and polars to see by ourselves the benefits of using polars.
4. Discover **fancier polars features** (lazy evaluation, streaming engine..)
